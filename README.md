# About this repo
This repository contains examples of different ETLs transformations on data. In an ideal world, the data we data scientists encounter would be in the exact format to analyze. Unfortunately most of the time, this is not the case, and we need to work with data not suitable for deep analysis.

All ETL transformations are done with Power Query and the code is implemented in Excel or Power BI files.
